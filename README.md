# Closing-the-Farm-Java-Silver
This is the SILVER version of the USACO Open 2016's Problem 3. Do NOT use this for Gold, you will get a memory exceeded limit on around Case 5 and above. Anyways, this is a GREAT model for DFS and it will be a good representation of the sorts of problems you'll see on the USACO Silver contest.
